# Kernel definitional equality is history-dependent, gated by a 32-bit `Expr.hash` collision

**Status: not unsoundness.** Every equivalence the kernel derives this way is
semantically valid. The defect is that the kernel's *accept/reject verdict* for a
definitional-equality query depends on which **unrelated** queries were performed
earlier while checking the same declaration, plus a 32-bit hash coincidence an
adversary can engineer cheaply.

Reproduces identically on **v4.32.0 and v4.32.2** (the kernel patched for #14576),
so this is independent of the recent nested-inductive and `opaqueDecl` defects.

## Mechanism

`equiv_manager` is a union-find over expressions. `type_checker::is_def_eq(t,s)`
calls `add_equiv(t,s)` on **every** success, including the recursive calls made by
`is_def_eq_args`, so the structure accumulates the transitive closure of every
definitional equality accepted so far in the current declaration check. But
definitional equality with proof irrelevance is **not** transitive (Carneiro,
*The Type Theory of Lean*), so the closure is strictly larger than the relation.

What normally hides this is the lookup guard in `is_equiv_core`:

    if (m_use_hash && hash(a) != hash(b)) return false;

Two expressions that are transitively merged but structurally different almost
always have different `Expr.hash`, so the union-find is never consulted for them.
Engineering a collision re-opens the lookup. Because `Expr.hash` is computed
bottom-up, a collision between `X` and `Z` propagates to any identical one-hole
context `C`: `hash(C[X]) == hash(C[Z])`.

Ruled out by direct test: `equiv_manager`'s `expr_map` is keyed by **structural
equality, not hash**, so colliding-but-distinct expressions do *not* collapse to a
single node. Only the lookup is hash-gated.

## Witness

A closed non-transitivity triple, `Classical.choice` the only axiom. `Acc Lt2 N2`
with an opaque accessibility proof `hs := Classical.choice ⟨Racc N2⟩`, and `cnt`
counting `Acc.intro` layers via `Acc.rec` at a `Nat` motive:

    A := cnt N2 hs            (stuck: Acc.rec on an opaque proof)
    B := cnt N2 (Racc N2)
    C := 2

    A =?= B   true    (definitional proof irrelevance on the Acc argument)
    B =?= C   true    (iota)
    A =?= C   false   (whnf A is a stuck Acc.rec)

Pad `A` and `C` into `A'`, `C'` sharing `hash = 1500901578` and `approxDepth = 6`
(`padE e n := (fun _ : Nat => e) n`; four collisions were found scanning 200k
constants). `Tag : Nat → Type | mk (n : Nat) : Tag n` forces the kernel's
`infer_let` to compare a let's ascribed index against its value's index, giving
ordered control over which comparisons run.

    isolated  A'=?=B   true
    isolated  B =?=C'  true
    isolated  A'=?=C'  FALSE          (fresh type_checker)

    one declaration = one type_checker = one equiv_manager
      A'=?=C' alone                      rejected
      A'=?=B ; A'=?=C'                   rejected
      B=?=C' ; A'=?=C'                   rejected
      A'=?=B ; B=?=C' ; A'=?=C'          ACCEPTED
      B=?=C' ; A'=?=B ; A'=?=C'          ACCEPTED   (order-independent)
      A'=?=B ; B=?=C' ; C'=?=A'          ACCEPTED   (symmetric)
      same three, no hash collision      rejected   (collision essential)     

    theorem (A' = C') by rfl, bare       rejected
    theorem (A' = C') by rfl, primed     ACCEPTED

The primed theorem states `cnt N2 hs = 2`, which is **true** — `Acc` is a
subsingleton, so `cnt` yields 2 for every proof. The kernel accepted a true
statement by a route it otherwise refuses. Transitively closing a semantically
valid relation stays valid, so the union-find is an amplifier, not a bug source.

## Why it is still worth fixing

1. **Non-reproducible checking.** Editing an unrelated part of a declaration can
   make a proof start or stop typechecking.
2. **Divergence from external checkers.** lean4checker, nanoda and lean4lean need
   not implement this cache, so a term Lean's kernel accepts can be rejected by
   independent verification — the exact guarantee those tools exist to provide.
3. **Amplification.** If any single unsound acceptance is ever found, the
   union-find spreads it transitively across the whole declaration.
4. The guard is a **32-bit** hash and collisions are cheap to search for.

## Not usable to derive `False` as-is

The `Acc` + proof-irrelevance pair `F () (p h) ≡ succ (F () h)` and `p h ≡ h` is
jointly `n ≡ n+1`, but exists only between terms mentioning a hypothesis
`h : Acc r a` with `r a a`, which `acc_irrefl` refutes. The cache having no
context key raises the possibility of merging two *closed* terms through an
intermediate mentioning such a hypothesis — but no closed data term is
definitionally equal to a stuck `Acc.rec`, so the bad equation has no closed
endpoints to export.

## Reproduction notes

- `lean` takes its toolchain from the **current directory**; outside a tree with a
  `lean-toolchain` that is the elan default. Pin explicitly:
  `elan run leanprover/lean4:v4.32.2 lean --trust=0 <file>`.
- **`Lean.addDecl` is asynchronous** in 4.32.x (`Elab.async` defaults true): the
  kernel check runs on a background task and the exception never reaches a
  synchronous `try`/`catch`, which silently turns rejections into "accepted".
  Use `set_option Elab.async false`, or the synchronous oracles
  `(← getEnv).toKernelEnv.addDecl {}` and `Lean.Kernel.isDefEq`.
- Judge outcomes by exit code and `#print axioms`, never by grepping for `error`.
