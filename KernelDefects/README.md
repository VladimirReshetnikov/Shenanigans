# Kernel defects: `False` with a clean audit

The only category in this directory that is anybody's fault. A defect belongs
here when the derived `False` is **closed** — no hypothesis, no flag, no
`sorry` — and the audit reports **nothing**:

```
'boom' does not depend on any axioms
```

That signature is exactly what a correct kernel is supposed to make impossible,
which is why every exhibit here ships with a control that produces the *same*
signature by cheating (see
[`Lean/Controls/NegativeControl.lean`](Lean/Controls/NegativeControl.lean)).
Acceptance of an exhibit means something only because the control is rejected by
the same procedure.

Contrast with [`../EscapeHatches/`](../EscapeHatches/), where the audit names
the cost, and [`../Paradoxes/`](../Paradoxes/), where the cost is a hypothesis
in the statement.

| Path | System | Substance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`Lean/`](Lean/) | Lean 4 | The name-keyed accelerator family (`Nat.add`, `Nat.beq`, the nine free names under `Init.Prelude`, `Lean.reduceBool`, and string-literal fabrication), `Expr.proj` index truncation, definitional-equality history dependence, and level-normalization incompleteness. With [`Comparator/`](Lean/Comparator/), which shows the Lean FRO's proof judge accepting one of them. |
| [`Coq/`](Coq/) | Rocq 9.2 | Four soundness defects from the 2026 sweep — three guard-checker, one module-system — all fixed upstream, kept as regression witnesses that must be *rejected*. |

## Reproducing

```bash
pwsh KernelDefects/Lean/verify.ps1
```
```bash
pwsh KernelDefects/Coq/verify.ps1
```

Expected final lines: `All 6 modules behaved as documented.` and
`All 4 Coq exhibits behaved as documented.`

## Why the two systems' defects cluster in different places

Of the Rocq proofs of `False` catalogued in [`../CATALOG.md`](../CATALOG.md) §3,
the great majority are guard-checker or module-system bugs. Neither subsystem
exists in Lean. Of Lean's, essentially all are in the three kernel *extensions*
Lean 3's own FAQ told you to disable with `-t0`: GMP-accelerated `Nat`
arithmetic, structure eta, and nested inductives.

* Rocq checks recursion with a syntactic **guard checker** over `Fixpoint`
  definitions, whose job — decide termination from the shape of a term — is
  subtle enough that a single refactor
  ([PR #17986](https://github.com/rocq-prover/rocq/pull/17986)) introduced four
  separate proofs of `False`. Lean compiles recursion to recursors and has no
  analogue.
* Rocq's **module system** — functors, aliases, `Include`, delta-resolution — is
  a large piece of trusted infrastructure with no Lean counterpart at all.
* Lean's **name-keyed normalizer extensions** are a large piece of trusted
  infrastructure with no Rocq counterpart: the kernel builds
  `g_nat_add = mkConst {"Nat","add"}` at startup and fires on any constant with
  that name, never checking that it is the real one.
* Lean's kernel is written in C++ with **fixed-width integer fields**, and
  `size_t`→`unsigned` truncation has now produced the same class of defect twice
  four years apart ([#1433](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/1433) in
  2022, [#12746](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/12746) in 2026 —
  fixed on `master` 2026-08-01 by
  [#14632](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/14632), though no released
  toolchain carries the fix yet and the issue itself is still open).

Neither observation makes either system safer overall. The point is that the two
systems' soundness risks live in structurally different places, so a catalog of
one says very little about the other.

## The status that matters most

The Lean accelerator family in [`Lean/Accelerators/`](Lean/Accelerators/) is
**reported and deliberately out of scope upstream**, not unreported.
[lean4#13626](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/13626) was closed
2026-05-04 with the maintainers' position stated explicitly:

> The kernel assumes that the official prelude is used. If you use `prelude` you
> are responsible for making sure it matches the kernel's expectations, i.e. It
> is not supported to write arbitrary code after `prelude`.

Every exhibit in that directory is a `prelude` module, so the policy covers all
of them — including `NatGcdFreeName.lean`, which redefines nothing. The exhibits
remain useful as a precise description of where that boundary lies and what is
on the far side of it, but they are a *policy* boundary, not an open hole.

`lean4lean`'s [`divergences.md`](https://github.com/digama0/lean4lean/blob/master/divergences.md)
states the same fact from the other side, and is worth quoting because it makes
the assumption explicit rather than treating it as obvious: Lean does not check
that primitives are declared with the correct types and definitional behaviour,
*"This is required for soundness, but Lean is able to get away with it because
Lean ships its prelude and using an alternative prelude is not supported."*
