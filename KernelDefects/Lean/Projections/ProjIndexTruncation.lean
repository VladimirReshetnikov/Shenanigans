PROJECTION INDEX TRUNCATION — `size_t` narrowed to `unsigned` in the kernel.

`Expr.proj` stores its field index as a `Nat`.  Three kernel paths in
`src/kernel/type_checker.cpp` (`infer_proj`, `reduce_proj`, and
`lazy_delta_proj_reduction`) move that index into a C++ `unsigned` after
checking only `is_small()`, which guarantees `< 2^63`, not `< 2^32`.  An index
of `2^32 + k` therefore silently becomes `k`.

Consequence: the kernel infers types for, reduces, and ACCEPTS declarations
containing projections whose index is out of range for the structure, treating
them as the aliased in-range field.  The surface elaborator refuses such indices
("Index `4294967298` is invalid for this structure"), so the defect is reachable
only from a metaprogram building `Expr.proj` directly — but `addDecl` is the
ordinary checked path, and it accepts the result.

This is NOT, by itself, a proof of `False`.  Truncation is applied consistently
by inference and by reduction, so the aliased projection stays internally
coherent: `x.(2^32+1)` behaves exactly like `x.1`, a true statement about a real
field.  Turning it into `False` requires two *distinct* fields to collide, i.e.
a structure with 2^32 fields — which is why upstream rates it P-medium.  What it
does establish is that the kernel's range check on projection indices can be
bypassed, and that `is_small()` is not a sufficient guard.

Upstream: lean4#12746 (P-medium, filed 2026-03-01, found by Opus 4.6).
lean4#13602 reported the same defect as an accepted theorem and was closed as a
duplicate of #12746.

FIXED ON `master` 2026-08-01 by lean4#14632, a five-part kernel hardening pass.
It adds a `to_proj_idx` helper that rejects an index above `UINT_MAX` — the bound
`is_small()` never had — and routes both `infer_proj` and `reduce_proj` through
it; the accompanying comment names `.proj S 2^32 c` becoming `.proj S 0 c` as the
failure mode, i.e. exactly this file.  Issue #12746 was still OPEN and unlabelled
as of 2026-08-01, and no released toolchain carries the fix, so the matrix below
stands and this module keeps its value as the regression witness: re-run it on the
first release after v4.33 and the first column should flip to `no`.

Verified with `elan run leanprover/lean4:<v> lean --trust=0` on this file:

  | toolchain    | truncated index accepted | control (index 2) |
  | v4.32.0      | yes                      | rejected          |
  | v4.32.2      | yes                      | rejected          |
  | v4.33.0-rc1  | yes                      | rejected          |

CONTROL (`smallOutOfRange`): the identical construction with a small
out-of-range index is rejected by the kernel, which is what makes acceptance of
the truncated index meaningful — the range check exists and works, and is
defeated only by the narrowing.

All `addDecl` calls below use the SYNCHRONOUS kernel entry point
`(← getEnv).toKernelEnv.addDecl {}`, not `Lean.addDecl`, because the latter is
asynchronous in 4.32.x and would report kernel rejections as acceptances.
